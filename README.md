This repository contains my configuration files for a minimalist and modern KDE Plasma environment on Arch Linux. The goal is to provide a consistent, visually pleasing, and highly functional desktop experience.

A glimpse of the setup:
üöÄ Features

    Desktop Environment: KDE Plasma 6 on Wayland.

    Minimalist Design: A clean and uncluttered user interface.

    Custom Theming: A dark global theme, with matching color scheme and icons.

    Efficient Panel: A customized bottom panel providing quick access to essential applications and system information.

    Intuitive Workflow: Designed for a smooth and productive user experience.

üì¶ Prerequisites

    A fresh installation of Arch Linux.

    KDE Plasma and its core components (plasma-desktop, plasma-wayland-session).

    Git for cloning this repository.

‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To install these dotfiles, follow these steps. Warning: This will overwrite your existing KDE Plasma configuration! It is highly recommended to back up your current dotfiles before proceeding.

    Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/plasma-dotfiles.git

    Navigate into the directory:

    cd plasma-dotfiles

    Copy the configuration files:
    The following command will copy the dotfiles to your home directory. Make sure you understand what you are copying.

    # Make sure to back up your existing ~/.config and ~/.local/share directories first!
    cp -r .config/* ~/.config/
    cp -r .local/share/* ~/.local/share/

    Install any custom themes, icons, or fonts:

        List any specific themes or icons you've used here.

        For example: The global theme is [Theme Name] and the icon pack is [Icon Pack Name].

    Restart your system or log out and back in:

    reboot

    This will ensure that KDE Plasma loads with the new configuration.

üîß Customization

To personalize this setup, you can modify the following files:

    Panel Configuration: The panel layout is controlled by ~/.config/plasmashellrc.

    Global Theme: Change the global theme and color scheme in ~/.config/kdeglobals.

    Wallpaper: Update your wallpaper by going to System Settings -> Workspace Behavior -> Desktop.
